General Equation: A-B(W/D)

Given Matrix:
n = [
73 23 59 
25 82 81 
]
------------------------
Iteration Count 1: 
R21-->> R21 - R11(R21/R11) == 0
R22-->> R22 - R12(R21/R11) == 74.12329
R23-->> R23 - R13(R21/R11) == 60.79452

Iteration Matrix:
n = [
73 23 59 
0 74.12329 60.79452 
]

Iteration Matrix (Column 1) :
n = [
73 23 59 
0 74.12329 60.79452 
]

X2 = (60.79452)/(74.12329) == 0.8201811
X1 = (59-(18.86416)(0.8201811))/(73) == 0.5498059
